3. Ensure your cluster metrics are being scraped

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Prometheus Configuration

Ensure your Prometheus configuration includes these scrape configs:

```yaml
# prometheus.yml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
        action: keep
        regex: true

  - job_name: 'kube-state-metrics'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: endpoints
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_name]
        action: keep
        regex: kube-state-metrics

  - job_name: 'kubelet'
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      ca_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
      insecure_skip_verify: true
    bearer_token_file: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: node
    relabel_configs:
      - action: labelmap
        regex: __meta_kubernetes_node_label_(.+)
    metric_relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__name__]
        regex: 'container_cpu_usage_seconds_total|container_memory_working_set_bytes'
        action: keep
```

### Cost Pricing Configuration

The dashboard uses default cloud pricing estimates. To customize:

1. **CPU Pricing** (default: $0.024 per CPU-hour):
   ```promql
   # Find this in the dashboard queries and modify:
   kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu"} * 1000 * 0.024
   # Change 0.024 to your actual CPU cost per core-hour
   ```

2. **Memory Pricing** (default: $0.012 per GB-hour):
   ```promql
   # Modify this multiplier:
   kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="memory"} / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 0.012
   # Change 0.012 to your actual memory cost per GB-hour
   ```

### Resource Thresholds

To modify the utilization thresholds:

1. **Oversized threshold** (default: < 20%):
   ```promql
   # Change 20 to your preferred percentage
   ) < 20
   ```

2. **Undersized threshold** (default: > 80%):
   ```promql  
   # Change 80 to your preferred percentage
   ) > 80
   ```

## üìñ Usage Guide

### For Business Stakeholders

1. **Quick Assessment**
   - Look at the pie charts at the top for immediate overview
   - Focus on orange (oversized) sections for cost-saving opportunities
   - Red sections indicate potential performance risks

2. **Priority Actions**
   - Review the analysis table sorted by "Potential Monthly Savings"
   - Focus on deployments with highest dollar impact first
   - Use the emoji indicators for quick status understanding

3. **Decision Making**
   - ‚úÖ Optimal: No action needed
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Oversized: Safe to reduce resource requests
   - üö® Undersized: Needs more resources or investigation

### For Technical Teams

1. **Deep Analysis**
   - Use the detailed table to see exact utilization percentages
   - Review trend charts to understand usage patterns over time
   - Cross-reference with application performance metrics

2. **Implementation Planning**
   - Start with highest-impact oversized deployments
   - Make gradual adjustments (10-20% reductions)
   - Monitor for 1-2 weeks before further optimization

3. **Validation Process**
   - Use time-series charts to confirm usage patterns
   - Check if low utilization is due to recent deployment or genuine over-provisioning
   - Consider business requirements and SLA needs

| Panel | Purpose | Action Items |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| üéØ CPU/Memory Overview | Executive summary of resource distribution | Identify overall optimization opportunity |
| üí∞ Deployment Analysis Table | Detailed per-deployment metrics | Prioritize optimization efforts |

## üî¨ Methodology

### Resource Utilization Calculation

**CPU Utilization:**
```promql
(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total[5m]) * 100) / 
(kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu"} * 1000)
```

**Memory Utilization:**
```promql
(container_memory_working_set_bytes) / 
(kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="memory"})
```

### Deployment Filtering

The dashboard specifically targets Kubernetes Deployments by:
- Filtering for pods created by ReplicaSets (`created_by_kind="ReplicaSet"`)
- Extracting deployment names from ReplicaSet naming convention
- Excluding StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, and CronJobs

### Cost Calculation Model

**Monthly Cost Estimate:**
- CPU: `CPU_cores √ó hours_per_month √ó cost_per_core_hour`
- Memory: `Memory_GB √ó hours_per_month √ó cost_per_GB_hour`
- Hours per month: 720 (24 √ó 30)

**Savings Calculation:**
- Identifies resources above/below optimal thresholds
- Calculates potential reduction for oversized resources
- Estimates monthly savings based on resource pricing

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. No Data in Dashboard

**Symptoms:**
- All panels show "No data"
- Queries return empty results

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check Prometheus connectivity
kubectl port-forward -n monitoring svc/prometheus-server 9090:80

# Verify metrics are being scraped
curl 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up{job="kubelet"}'

# Check kube-state-metrics
kubectl get pods -n monitoring | grep kube-state-metrics
kubectl logs -n monitoring deployment/kube-state-metrics
```

#### 2. Deployments Not Appearing

**Symptoms:**
- Expected deployments missing from table
- Lower counts than expected

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Check if pods have resource requests
kubectl describe deployment <deployment-name> | grep -A 10 "requests"

# Verify ReplicaSet labeling
kubectl get replicasets -o custom-columns="NAME:.metadata.name,OWNER:.metadata.ownerReferences[0].name"

# Check pod creation method
kubectl get pods -o yaml | grep "created_by_kind"
```

**Solutions:**
- Ensure deployments have resource requests defined
- Verify ReplicaSet naming follows standard convention
- Check if workloads are actually Deployments (not StatefulSets, etc.)

#### 3. Incorrect Cost Calculations

**Symptoms:**
- Unrealistic savings amounts
- Negative values in cost fields

**Solutions:**
```promql
# Verify pricing constants
# CPU pricing (modify 0.024 as needed)
kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu"} * 1000 * 0.024

# Memory pricing (modify 0.012 as needed)  
kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="memory"} / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 0.012
```

#### 4. Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Dashboard loads slowly
- Grafana becomes unresponsive

**Solutions:**
- Increase query intervals from 30s to 1m or 5m
- Add namespace filters to reduce query scope
- Implement Prometheus recording rules for complex calculations
- Consider using separate Grafana instance for resource monitoring

### Debugging Queries

**Test individual components:**

```promql
# Basic container metrics
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!="POD",container!=""}

# Resource requests
kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu"}

# Pod-to-deployment mapping
kube_pod_info{created_by_kind="ReplicaSet"}

# Complete utilization calculation
(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{container!="POD",container!=""}[5m]) * 100) /
(kube_pod_container_resource_requests{resource="cpu"} * 1000)
```

### Data Collection Requirements

**Minimum collection period:** 2-4 weeks for accurate patterns
**Recommended refresh interval:** 30 seconds to 5 minutes
**Historical data retention:** 30+ days for trend analysis

## üí° Cost Optimization Workflow

### Phase 1: Assessment (Week 1-2)

1. **Install and configure** the dashboard
2. **Collect baseline data** for 2 weeks minimum
3. **Identify patterns** in resource utilization
4. **Document findings** and create optimization plan

### Phase 2: Planning (Week 3)

1. **Prioritize deployments** by potential savings
2. **Assess business impact** of each optimization
3. **Create rollback plans** for critical applications
4. **Schedule optimization windows** during low-traffic periods

### Phase 3: Implementation (Week 4+)

1. **Start with highest-impact, lowest-risk** deployments
2. **Make incremental changes** (10-20% adjustments)
3. **Monitor application performance** closely
4. **Wait 3-7 days** between optimization rounds

### Phase 4: Validation (Ongoing)

1. **Track cost savings** using dashboard metrics
2. **Monitor application health** and performance
3. **Document lessons learned** for future optimizations
4. **Repeat cycle** quarterly or as needed

### Best Practices

- **Never optimize during peak business hours**
- **Always have rollback procedures ready**
- **Coordinate with application owners**
- **Monitor for at least 48 hours after changes**
- **Document all changes for compliance**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

### Technical Limitations

1. **Workload Patterns**
   - May not account for seasonal or cyclical usage patterns
   - Short-term spikes might not be captured in 5-minute averages
   - Cold start effects can skew new deployment metrics

2. **Kubernetes Scope**
   - Only covers Deployment workloads (excludes StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs)
   - Requires resource requests to be defined
   - Multi-container pods are aggregated, potentially masking individual issues

3. **Cost Accuracy**
   - Uses estimated cloud pricing, not actual billing
   - Doesn't account for reserved instances or volume discounts
   - No consideration for networking, storage, or other costs

4. **Metric Limitations**
   - Depends on Prometheus data retention policies
   - 5-minute rate windows may miss very brief spikes
   - Network partitions can create data gaps

### Business Limitations

1. **Context Awareness**
   - Cannot determine business criticality of applications
   - No awareness of SLA requirements or compliance needs
   - May suggest optimizations that conflict with disaster recovery plans

2. **Performance Correlation**
   - Doesn't directly measure application performance impact
   - Can't predict performance degradation from resource reductions
   - No integration with APM or user experience metrics

### Operational Considerations

1. **Change Management**
   - Requires coordination with application teams
   - May conflict with existing capacity planning processes
   - Needs integration with deployment and change approval workflows

2. **Monitoring Dependencies**
   - Requires robust Prometheus setup with proper retention
   - Depends on accurate kube-state-metrics configuration
   - Dashboard performance scales with cluster size
